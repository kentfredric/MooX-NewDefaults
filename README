MooX::NewDefaults

Ever start using a package from the CPAN, only to discover that it
requires lots of subclassing and "has '+foo' => (default => ...)"? It's
not recommended Moose best practice, and it's certainly not the
prettiest thing ever, either.

That's where we come in.

This package introduces new sugar that you can use in your class,
"default_for" (as seen above).

e.g.

    has '+foo' => (default => sub { 'a b c' });

...is the same as:

    default_for foo => sub { 'a b c' };
